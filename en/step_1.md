These Sushi Cards will introduce you to wearable electronics. These are electronic circuits you can make using especially designed components (parts) to create amazing-looking clothes and accessories. 

You will get to learn about and make electronic circuits, and you'll also do some sewing.
 
You can use wearable electronics to decorate clothes, bags, hats, anything — the possibilities are unlimited!
