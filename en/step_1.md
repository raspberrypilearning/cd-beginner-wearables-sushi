## Introduction

These Sushi Cards will introduce you to Wearable Electronics. These are electronic circuits made using components (parts) especially designed to be sewn directly into clothes or accessories. 

You will get to learn about and make electronic circuits and also do some sewing.
 
You can use this stuff to decorate clothes, bags, hats... The possibilities are unlimited!
